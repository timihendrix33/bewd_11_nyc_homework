# Homework #1 - Secret Number Game
# In this game players have three tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 10. 
#
# Here are some guidelines to building your game:
#
#	Intros
# 	  +	Welcome the player to your game. Let them know who created the game. 
#	  +	Ask for the player's name then personally greet them by printing to the screen, "Hi player_name!"
#	  +	Any good game will communicate the rules. Let the player know they must guess a number between 1 and 10 
#		and that they only have 3 tries to do so.
#
#	Functionality: 
#	 +	Hard code the secret number. Make it a random number between 1 and 10.
#	 + 	Ask the user for their guess.
#	 +	Verify if they were correct. If the player guesses correctly they win the game they should be congratulated and the game should end.
#	 +	If they guess incorrectly, give the player some direction. If they guess too high let them know, if they guess too low, let them know.
#	 + 	Don't forget to let your players know how many guesses they have left. Your game should say something like
#		  "You have X many guesses before the game is over enter a another number"
#	 +	If they don't guess correctly after 3 tries, print that the Player lost and the game is over. Also let them know what the `secret_number` was.
#
# Make sure to add helpful comments to your code to document what each section does.
# 
# Remember to cast input from the Player into the appropriate data type.
