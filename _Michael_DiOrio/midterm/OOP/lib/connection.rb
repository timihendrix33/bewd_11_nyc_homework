## Class that opens Twitter API connection. Not sure if I'm doing it right


class Connection 
	attr_accessor :decision, :tweets

	def initialize(decision)
		$decision= decision
		$tweets= tweets ## $tweets is the json.parse(body) from Twitter api
	end

## this method takes the user's input (trends or tweets) and then assigns the variables appropriately. 
## If the user wants to see trends then the configure method will change the path to 1.1/trends
## The address in configure is broken into baseurl (api.twitter.com) and then the path/query.
## id =>1 for trends around the world. For decision "t" the user is asked the keyword they want to search on and the number of tweets


def type 
	if $decision !="t" and $decision !="tr" and $decision !="w"
		puts "Please re-enter your query: tweets(t) or trends(tr) or word cloud (w)!"
		$decision= gets.chomp
	end
	if $decision =="t" or $decision =="tr" or $decision =="w"
		if $decision=="t"
			puts "Ok cool, what keyword would you like to search on?"
			@question= gets.chomp
			puts "Ok, and how many tweets?"
			@count_tweets= gets.chomp
			@path    = "/1.1/search/tweets.json"
			@query   = URI.encode_www_form(
		  		"q" => "#{@question}",
		  		"count" => "#{@count_tweets}",)
		elsif $decision == "tr"
			@path = "/1.1/trends/place.json"
			@query   = URI.encode_www_form(
	   			"id" => "1",)
		elsif $decision == "w"
			@path = "/1.1/search/tweets.json"
			@query   = URI.encode_www_form(
		  		"q" => "",
		  		"geocode" => "37.781157,-122.398720,10mi",
		  		"count" => "5")
		else

## Ok this is the method that connects to the Twitter API and sends a success message if it connects successfully. 
## Takes in the consumer/access tokens
## line 67 is important since $tweets is the info from the API. Is there a better way to do this?
