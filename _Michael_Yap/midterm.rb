# Office Hours Notes
# ==============================================================================
# Calculate the current time, offer 24 hrs forecast
# Break up the program in separate files
# For lines 32 and on, put in a separate file
# In the main rb file, call the class
# Create a git branch, to put the working program into a branch
# git checkout -b name-of-branch
# git checkout name-of-branch
# git branch

# Assignment
# ==============================================================================

# Create a command line based application that fulfills these criteria:

# 1) Takes user input and handles bad input (i.e. You expect numbers and they give you a letter).
# 2) Connects to a 3rd party api where the call varies based on what the user gives you.
# 3) Must be object oriented. You must instantiate modeled classes. The only file that can run without classes is your runner.
# 4) Push code on Github.

# Pseudocode

# Provide a report
